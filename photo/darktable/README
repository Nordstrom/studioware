darktable ( Photo Editor )

Darktable is an open source photography workflow application and RAW developer.
A virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers. It manages your digital
negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and
enables you to develop raw images and enhance them. It does non-destructive
edits by saving edit data in .xmp files, which gives it a big advantage over
traditional editors like Gimp etc.
