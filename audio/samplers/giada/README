giada-0.8.4 ( Your hardcore looping machine )

Giada is a free, minimal, hardcore audio tool for DJs, live performers and
electronic musicians. How does it work? Just pick up your channel, fill it with
samples or MIDI events and start the show by using this tiny piece of software
as a loop machine, drum machine, sequencer, live sampler or yet as a
plugin/effect host.
