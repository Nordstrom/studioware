TerminatorX (RealTime Audio Synthesizer)

TerminatorX is a realtime audio synthesizer that allows you to scratch on digitally sampled audio data (*.wav, *.au, *.ogg, *.mp3, etc.) the way hiphop-DJs scratch on vinyl records. It features multiple turntables, realtime effects (built-in as well as LADSPA plugin effects), a sequencer and MIDI interface - all accessible through an easy-to-use gtk+ GUI.

Note that to get best results from this you need to be in the input group. It
will still work without that, but you will get warnings when starting up. To
add yourself to input:

usermod -a -G input <username>

as root.
