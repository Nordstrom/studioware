Hexter (Keyboard Synthesizer)

hexter is a software synthesizer that models the sound generation of
a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. It can easily load most DX7 patch bank
files, edit those patches via a built-in editor or MIDI sys-ex
messages (ALSA systems only), and recreate the sound of the DX7 with
greater accuracy than any previous open-source emulation.
