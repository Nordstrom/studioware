# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

hexter:
hexter: hexter is a software synthesizer that models the sound generation of
hexter: a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. It can easily load most DX7 patch bank
hexter: files, edit those patches via a built-in editor or MIDI sys-ex
hexter: messages (ALSA systems only), and recreate the sound of the DX7 with
hexter: greater accuracy than any previous open-source emulation.
