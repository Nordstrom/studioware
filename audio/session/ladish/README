Ladish (LADI Session Handler)

LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management system
for JACK applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow you to have
many different audio programs running at once, to save their setup,
close them down and then easily reload the setup at some other time.

Ladish doesn't deal with any kind of audio or MIDI data itself;
it just runs programs, deals with saving/loading (arbitrary) data and
connects JACK ports together. It can also be used to move entire
sessions between computers, or post sessions on the Internet for
download.
