# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

nnls-chroma: nnls-chroma (NNLS CHroma Vamp Plugins)
nnls-chroma:
nnls-chroma: NNLS Chroma analyses a single channel of audio using frame-wise
nnls-chroma: spectral input from the Vamp host. The plugin was originally
nnls-chroma: developed to extract treble and bass chromagrams for subsequent use
nnls-chroma: in chord extraction methods. The spectrum is transformed to a
nnls-chroma: log-frequency spectrum (constant-Q) with three bins per semitone. On
nnls-chroma: this representation, two processing steps are performed: * tuning,
nnls-chroma: after which each centre bin (i.e. bin 2, 5, 8, â€¦) corresponds to a
nnls-chroma: semitone, even if the tuning of the piece deviates from 440 Hz
nnls-chroma: standard pitch.
