NNLS CHroma Vamp Plugins

NNLS Chroma analyses a single channel of audio using frame-wise spectral input
from the Vamp host. The plugin was originally developed to extract treble and
bass chromagrams for subsequent use in chord extraction methods. The spectrum
is transformed to a log-frequency spectrum (constant-Q) with three bins per
semitone. On this representation, two processing steps are performed:
* tuning, after which each centre bin (i.e. bin 2, 5, 8, â€¦) corresponds to a
	semitone, even if the tuning of the piece deviates from 440 Hz standard
	pitch.
* running standardisation: subtraction of the running mean, division by the
	running standard deviation. This has a spectral whitening effect.

The processed log-frequency spectrum is then used as an input for NNLS
approximate transcription (using a dictionary of harmonic notes with
geometrically decaying harmonics magnitudes). The output of the NNLS
approximate transcription is semitone-spaced. To get the chroma, this semitone
spectrum is multiplied (element-wise) with the desired profile (chroma or bass
chroma) and then mapped to 12 bins. The resulting chroma frames can be
normalised by (dividing by) their norm (L1, L2 and maximum norm available).
