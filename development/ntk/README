ntk is a fast and lightweight GUI toolkit for the Non-DAW application
suite. It is a build requirement of Non, and is distributed along with
Non source code. It is packaged separately for SlackBuilds.org because
in order for Non-* to build, ntk must be installed first. Ergo,
install this first, and then build and install Non.

The only official download is available as a git repository. In order
to standardize this SlackBuild, a snapshot of the git repository as of
the 1.1.0 release has been posted to http://slackermedia.info, which
this SlackBuild uses.
