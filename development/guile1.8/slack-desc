# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

guile1.8:
guile1.8: Guile is a library designed to help programmers create flexible
guile1.8: applications. Using Guile in an application allows the application's 
guile1.8: functionality to be extended by users or other programmers with
guile1.8: plug-ins, modules, or scripts. Guile provides what might be described
guile1.8: as "practical software freedom," making it possible for users to
guile1.8: customize an application to meet their needs without digging into the
guile1.8: application's internals.
