Files:
/etc/sepkg/sepkg.conf
This file contains the mirror URL and should be edited for slackware version.

Notes:
searching for '.' will list all files and so will 'install .' etc

Install options can be given on the command line or in a file:

Examples:
# sepkg install ardour WIIMOTE=yes

# cat queue
ardour WIIMOTE=yes
# sepkg install < queue

With a queue file, seperate packages on newlines. When doing it via command separate packages with a comma:

# sepkg install ardour WIIMOTE=yes, dssi, lash
