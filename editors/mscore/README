MuseScore ( music notation editor ) 

MuseScore is a free cross-platform WYSIWYG music notation program, that offers a cost-effective alternative to professional programs such as Sibelius and Finale.  You can print beautifully engraved sheet music or save it as PDF or MIDI file.

The Makefile sets the number of jobs to the number of CPU cores by default. You can change the number of jobs by doing, for example:

JOBS=6 ./mscore.SlackBuild
