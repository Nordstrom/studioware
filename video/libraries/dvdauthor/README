dvdauthor (DVD authoring tools)

DVDAuthor is a set of tools to help you author the file and
directory structure of a DVD-Video disc, including programmatic
commands for implementing interactive behaviour. It is driven by
command lines and XML control files, though there are other
programs that provide GUI-based front ends if you prefer.
