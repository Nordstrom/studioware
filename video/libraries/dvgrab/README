dvgrab (grab audio and video data)

dvgrab receives audio and video data from a digital camcorder via an
IEEE 1394 (widely known as FireWire) link and stores them into an AVI
file. It features autosplit of long video sequences into several
files, and supports saving the data as raw frames, AVI type 1, AVI
type 2, and image files.
