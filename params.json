Most of us   are musicians too.\r\n\r\nNetwork\r\n-------\r\n\r\nApart from this website we also have an IRC channel and mailing list. Everyone is welcome to join #studioware on irc.freenode.net. The mailing list can be found here: http://groups.google.com/group/studioware\r\n\r\nGet Involved!\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWe want to hear about your experiences too. Any hints or tips or other useful things that you've discovered while building or running packages you'd like to share will be welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll content © 2011-2013 studioware.org  \r\nSlackware® © Patrick Volkerding  \r\nLinux® © Linus Torvalds  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
