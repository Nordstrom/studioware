# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

Xdialog: Xdialog (GTK2+ Dialogs)
Xdialog:
Xdialog: Xdialog is designed to be a drop in replacement for the "dialog" or
Xdialog: "cdialog" programs. It converts any terminal based program into a
Xdialog: program with an X-windows interface. The dialogs are easier to see
Xdialog: and use while adding even more functionalities (e.g. with the
Xdialog: treeview, the file selector, the edit box, the range box, the help
Xdialog: button/box). Because Xdialog uses GTK+, it will also match your
Xdialog: desktop theme.
