xfce-menus ( Custom Studioware Menus for XFCE )

These are needed to create our custom Studioware submenu.

Note that this package backs up you default menu layout file and then copies ours over:

Default: /etc/xdg/menus/xfce-applications.menu.orig
Ours: /etc/xdg/menus/xfce-applications.menu

If you ever want to remove this package, you need to copy the .orig back to it's original name.

We have monochrome and colour icons in this pacakge. You can switch between
them using the included studioware-xfce-icon-switch script:

studioware-xfce-icon-switch -c
studioware-xfce-icon-switch -m

You may need to run 'xfdesktop --reload' afterwards to see the changes.
