xfce-menus ( Custom Studioware Menus for XFCE )

These are needed to create our custom Studioware submenu.

Note that this package backs up you default menu layout file and then copies ours over:

Default: /etc/xdg/menus/xfce-applications.menu.orig
Ours: /etc/xdg/menus/xfce-applications.menu

If you ever want to remove this package, you need to copy the .orig back to it's original name.
